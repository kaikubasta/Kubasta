# Kubasta
*Kubasta* is yet another pixel font created with [BitFontMaker2](http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/). Perfectly applicable for retro UI and/or games. Firstly published on [Dafont] (http://www.dafont.com/de/kubasta.font) in 2014. Converted with [Everything Fonts](https://everythingfonts.com/). Any feedback is welcome.

## Anti-aliasing
You probably want to render pixel fonts without any [anti-aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_anti-aliasing).

### Desktop fonts
Click on the *Type Tool* and choose *None* on the anti-aliasing drop-down menu.

### Web fonts
Do only use the base `font-size` like `1rem`/`100%` or add multiple amounts like `200%` and the following CSS code:
```css
-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
text-rendering: optimizeLegibility;
```

## Forks
You are invited to fork this font. The most simple way to do so is [BitFontMaker2](http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/). Simply import the `source.json` and you are ready to go.

## Todo
* CSS with font imports
* Add some screenshots
